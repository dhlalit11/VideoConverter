    <string name="action_about">About App</string>
    <string name="about_info_text">This project was originally created by dstukalov. I found this project in June of 2025 after it had been inactive for over three years. I forked the project to improve it. My initial focus was on updating its outdated UI, enable saving of processed videos to user accessible location, and adding more compression presets. I plan to continue improving the app with additional features and refinements as i deem fit.</string>

    <string name="important_info_text_message">\nHere is a quick guide:\n\n1. How it Works:\n   - Select a video you want to compress.\n   - Choose a compression preset (e.g., 720p, 1080p H265). Different presets offer different balances between file size and quality.\n   - Tap \'Compress this video\'. The app will process your video to reduce its file size.\n\n2. Where Videos are Stored:\n   - Compressed videos are saved in your device\'s main \'Movies\' folder, inside a subfolder named \'Compressed-Videos\'.\n   - You can access these videos using your phone\'s gallery app or any file manager.\n\n3. Creating Videos:\n   - The app creates a new, smaller video file. Your original video is NOT modified or deleted by the compression process.\n\n4. Deleting Videos:\n   - To delete compressed videos created by this app, navigate to the \'Compressed videos\' list within the app (if available) and use the delete option, OR\n   - Use your device\'s gallery or file manager to go to the \'Movies/Compressed-Videos/\' folder and delete files from there like any other file.\n\n5. Important Notes:\n   - Compression can take time, especially for long or high-resolution videos. The app will show progress.\n   - The actual final size and quality depend on the original video and the chosen preset.\n   - H.265 (HEVC) offers better compression but might not be compatible with all older devices or players.\n\nEnjoy using the app\!</string>
    <string name="app_updated_text_message">\nChangelog:\nThe app now uses input file directly without copying it to a temp file first.\n- This results in almost instant video load for compression.\n- This change also fixed the bug where subsequent file load would fail.\nAdded input filename to input section.\nAdded output filename to output section.\n- Output filename will appear after compress button is pressed.\nAdded Styles XML for Android 9+ devices.\n- Android 9+ devices now have proper rounded corners in dialogs (delete, info message etc).\nImproved sharing dialog in library section.\nFixed bug where some of the layout was visible before any video was loaded.\nFixed some typos in about section.</string>
